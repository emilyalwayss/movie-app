This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Set Up

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/emilyalwayss/movie-app.git`<br>
Navigate to the directory<br>
`yarn install` to install all dependencies<br>
`yarn start` to run the app in development mode<br>

### Design Decisions

I created a separate component for each element that had functionality/logic that could be isolated, or if I could imagine some possibility where it could be reused somewhere else.

### Future Improvements

I would spend more time testing on different browsers/devices for (IE) bugs and responsiveness issues.
